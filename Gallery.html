            During my grade 11 year in high school, I took a course on guitar building. The course took me through the process of applying a finish to a nearly complete guitar body, and assembling the finished product myself. 
            That program dragged me into a rabbit hole so deep I will spend the rest of my life without ever finding my way out. Since then, I have refinished that guitar, as well as built another completely from scratch. 
            I have also discovered an incredible online community that helps fuel each others' creativity for their next project. My career will fund a workshop that I will spend the rest of my life in.

            Another one of my lifelong passion projects is my PC builds. I always stick to only having one, as I don't have a need for more than that, but I take pride and put plenty of effort into the single build I own. 
            The current specs are a soon to be upgraded Ryzen 5 3600, paired with an XFX QCK319 RX6750XT. 32GB of RAM keeps the machine running smooth and 3 total terrabytes of solid state storage keeps all my games ready on demand.
