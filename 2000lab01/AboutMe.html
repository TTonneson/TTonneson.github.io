        My name is Trey Tonneson, welcome to my website! I am currently studying Computer Engineering at NAIT, with the most attractive focus in the program being programming. My interest in tech started with me spending countless hours on my Xbox 360, and blossomed when I built my first PC in 2015. 
        Since then, the passion has continued to grow, with months and months worth of studying tech. I chose the CNT program at NAIT as it popped out to me when I was researching the start of my career, and made the most sense for what I wish to achieve. 
        My current goals are to finish this program, then move on into the cybersecurity program also offered at NAIT. I also want my current path to eventually lead me into a career in game development, as I've known gaming for longer than I've known almost anything else in my life.
